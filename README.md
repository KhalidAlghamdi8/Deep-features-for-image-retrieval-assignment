# Deep-features-for-image-retrieval-assignment


SFrame / Graphlab

This assignment focuses on using deep learning to create nonlinear features to improve the performance of machine learning. You will see how transfer learning techniques are applied to use deep features learned with one dataset to get great performance on a different dataset. You will build models for image retrieval and image classification tasks.

Follow the rest of the instructions on this page to complete your program. When you are done, instead of uploading your code, you will answer a series of quiz questions (see the quiz after this reading) to document your completion of this assignment. The instructions will indicate what data to collect for answering the quiz.
